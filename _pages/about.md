Colt Jensen is a Ph.D. candidate in the Public Administration and Policy program at the University of Georgia. He specializes in state and local government management, public personnel administration, and network governance. His current research focuses on rural local governance, the role of public values in government decision-making processes, and the evolving influence of government labor unions on public personnel outcomes. He is working to complete his dissertation by summer 2024.

His most recent publications are now available online in [Public Administration Review](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/puar.13794) and in the [American Review of Public Administration](https://doi.org/10.1177/02750740231200449).

## Research Interests

Thank you for visiting my website! I am currently working on my dissertation and several other exciting research projects. Below, I have outlined the research questions that are driving my dissertation research. 

### Dissertation - Rural Local Governance:
- **Beyond the Urban-Rural Dichotomy:** How can we develop a comprehensive and globally applicable concept of 'rurality' that preserves the nuanced differences within rural areas, eliminating the limitations of a binary rural-urban classification?
- **Rurality Measurement:** In public administration, rurality metrics often rely on census data, which varies significantly worldwide. This creates a challenge known as the modifiable areal unit problem. How can we redefine and quantify rurality in a way that fosters a cohesive and sustainable international rural administration research agenda?
- **Ecology and Governance:** Do the ecological aspects of rural areas, such as physical isolation from urban cores and limited connective infrastructure, impact administrative decision-making? For example, does the rural context affect rural local government's awareness of available grants or local government capacity? If such relationships exist, would theories of network governance, like the ICA framework, benefit from integrating the 'biophysical conditions' outlined in the IAD framework?
