I am a PhD candidate in the Public Administration and Policy program at UGA. My dissertation will be complete by Summer 2024.

## Research Interests

I'm broadly interested in topics related to public personnel administration and public management at the state and local levels of U.S. government. This includes:
- Understanding how varying degrees of rurality influence local government decision making and networking behaviors
- The evolving relationship between government labor unions and public personnel outcomes
