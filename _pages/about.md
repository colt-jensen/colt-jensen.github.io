## Research Interests

Thank you for visiting my website! I am broadly interested in topics related to public personnel administration and public management at the state and local levels of U.S. government. This includes:
- Understanding how varying degrees of rurality influence local government decision-making and networking behaviors
- The evolving relationship between government labor unions and public personnel outcomes
- How theories of intergovernmental collaboration such as the ICA framework apply to rural local governance networks
