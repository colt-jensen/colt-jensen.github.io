## Personal

In addition to public administration, I enjoy being outdoors and hiking. I grew up in Boone, NC near the Appalachian Trail and other great trails along the Blue Ridge Parkway. I also grew up on a [family farm](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100064850944088) that my parents still own and operate. As an undergraduate student I called football and basketball games for the university radio station.
