            <li>"Dr. Jensen--Probably one of the best professors I have ever had (both graduate and undergraduate level). I signed up for another course with Dr. Jensen because his teaching style is professional, yet I still felt comfortable enough to engage with the material. He created a respected learning environment and used every minute of class to benefit our coursework. Everything was done with intention, as a busy student working full-time, I actually looked forward to our Wednesday night lecture as I believe it has truly helped me become a better public servant."</li>
            <li>"The support from Colt was amazing. He was available for phone calls, emails, and zoom and was very quick to respond. I was not expecting that level of personalization. Thanks!"</li>

            <li>"Professor Jensen's very informative and exciting lectures, the weekly study guides, the additional materials that were made available, and ALL of his feedback have been absolutely phenomenal and have contributed to my learning. He has thoroughly explained concepts and responds to emails, Perusall messages, and Folio messages very quickly. Professor Jensen has truly left no brick unturned. He has it figured out! Kudos, kudos, kudos!!!"</li>
            <li>"While there were required readings, Dr. Jensen also provided additional readings so that students like me could dive deeper and find greater context for the content. The lectures were precise, which I appreciate, and he gave us a lot of autonomy on how to do our work. Additionally, I disclosed there were some family matters that may arise during the semester, and he gave me empathy, understanding, as well as provided me with resources and flexibility for if there were ever a time I'd need it. I very much appreciated that."</li>
            <li>"I appreciate the activity-based approach of this [HRM] course, as it focuses on real-life applications rather than conventional assignments or homework. These activities help us connect classroom learning to real-world scenarios, making the lessons more practical and engaging. "</li>
